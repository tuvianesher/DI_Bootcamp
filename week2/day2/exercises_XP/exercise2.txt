No, it is not possible to add more integers to an existing tuple in Python. Tuples are immutable, meaning that once created, their elements cannot be modified. This includes adding, removing, or changing elements.

If you need to store a collection of integers that can be modified, you should use a list instead of a tuple. Lists are mutable and allow for adding, removing, and modifying elements.
